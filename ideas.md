Innovative Idea
	Pokemon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. The games are massively popular, so much so that 
they are the highest grossing franchise in existence, with an estimated total revenue of $90 billion. In the pokemon games, there are hundreds 
of these creatures (known as pokemon), and each have their own classifications known as their type (a kind of element that determines their attacks).
	Our application would be an assistant for the game that players can use in coordination with the game. This would include various tools such as an 
interactable pokemon tracker/list, a lookup for pokemon statistics and a calculator for pokemon weaknesses.

Important Components
	We want to create a function where users can use to track what Pokemon they have collected in the game by having a unique login and looking 
at their personal checklist of Pokemon. We would also like to allow the users to click on the pokemon to see more information about them (such as in game statistics and what not). 
In addition, we would also have a “calculator” to be able to see what pokemon are strong against others. We could also include features such as a map of where to find pokemon, a lookup 
for more information (such as youtube or wiki pages) and other similar resources.
