Part 0 Project API planning

The PokeAssist API is based on REST principles. Data resources are accessed via standard HTTPS requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Where possible, Web API uses appropriate HTTP verbs for each action:
Method 	Action
GET 	Retrieves resources
POST 	Creates resources
PUT 	Changes and/or replaces resources or collections
DELETE 	Deletes resources
