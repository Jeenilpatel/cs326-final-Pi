Innovative Idea

Pokemon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. The games are massively popular, so much so that 
they are the highest grossing franchise in existence, with an estimated total revenue of $90 billion. In the pokemon games, there are hundreds 
of these creatures (known as pokemon), and each have their own classifications known as their type (a kind of element that determines their attacks).
	Our application would be an assistant for the game that players can use in coordination with the game. This would include various tools such as an 
interactable pokemon tracker/list, a lookup for pokemon statistics and a calculator for pokemon weaknesses.

Important Components

We want to create a function where users can use to track what Pokemon they have collected in the game by having a unique login and looking 
at their personal checklist of Pokemon. We would also like to allow the users to click on the pokemon to see more information about them (such as in game statistics and what not). 
In addition, we would also have a “calculator” to be able to see what pokemon are strong against others. We could also include features such as a map of where to find pokemon, a lookup 
for more information (such as youtube or wiki pages) and other similar resources.

The pages we will include are as follows:
1. A home page/landing page, that has a group of buttons to direct the user to the different pages; along with some information on what they should expect from our webpage.
2. A pokedex, which is a full list of the pokemon included in the game (for this project, we plan on only focusing on the first generation of the games). This page would have the functionality 
of a checklist for the user to click on the pokemon they currently own in order to mark that they have it. The user will also be able to click on a "more info" button for each pokemon
in order to open up a new page of information about any given pokemon
3. An information page for each pokemon will be included, and can be navigated to as described in the previous page. The information will include the pokemon's base stat's, which include it's
HP (hit points), Attack, defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed and total. We will also include a list of it's evolutions and required level to evolve, along with links to those evolutions,
 and a map that will show where to aquire the pokemon.
4. An interactive map of the game. It will be a full world map, that can be clicked on to open a page up about the individual areas that are clicked. Each area's page should show a list of avaialble pokemon.
5. A type calculator that will allow the user to input any combo of 1 or 2 pokemon type, and it will return to the user a list of types that it's strong against, neutral against and weak against.
