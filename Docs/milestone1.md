2. Pokedex:
A pokedex, which is a full list of the pokemon included in the game (for this project, we plan on only focusing on the first generation of the games). This page would have the functionality of a checklist for the user to click on the pokemon they currently own in order to mark that they have it. The user will also be able to click on a "more info" button for each pokemon. Also wtih that, it will have a list of all the pokemons and their evolution and would be a scrolling page, anyone can view this even they are not logged in. It will have the inofmration of the pokemon the type ad the description the poekeomon. We will also, have an option avaliable where the user "trainer" can select favorite pokemon and have a dropdown menu where they can filter by "Favorites" and "Collection" which will eihter show favorites or all the pokemon in your collection.

4. Type Calculator:
The type calculator will allow users to input one or two types of pokemon of their choice and will return a list of the types of pokemon that they are strong against, weak against, normal strength against, or invunerable to. This will help the users to figure out what weaknesses their team will have and can help them in battle to figure out what moves they should use against any given pokemon.
